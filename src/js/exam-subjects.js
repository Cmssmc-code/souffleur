      title: 'Stablecoins go mainstream: should banks be worried?',
      source: 'Practice text — inspired by the US and European financial press, 2026',
      date: 'October 2026',
      question: 'To what extent should traditional banks fear the rise of regulated stablecoins?',
      paragraphs: [
        "For years, stablecoins were treated as a curiosity of the crypto world: digital tokens pegged to the dollar, used mainly by traders to move money between exchanges. That era is over. Since the GENIUS Act was signed into law in July 2025, the United States has had its first federal framework for “payment stablecoins”, and the total value of these tokens in circulation has climbed above $300 billion. Large retailers, payment companies and even some banks are now preparing to issue their own.",
        "The law sets out clear rules. Issuers must hold at least one dollar of reserves for every token, in cash, bank deposits or short-term Treasury bills, and publish the composition of those reserves every month. They are banned from paying interest to holders, and the largest issuers fall under the supervision of federal regulators. Supporters argue that this finally gives the industry the legitimacy it lacked. “Clear rules attract serious players,” says the head of a payments start-up in San Francisco.",
        "Yet traditional banks are watching nervously. Their business model relies on cheap deposits, which they lend out to households and companies. If consumers and firms move part of their cash into stablecoins, banks could lose a stable source of funding. Some analysts estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars of deposits could leave the banking system over the next decade, pushing up funding costs and reducing credit to small businesses.",
        "Banks also point to a loophole. Although issuers cannot pay interest directly, the crypto exchanges that distribute the tokens can offer “rewards” to their customers. Lobbyists for the banking industry say this creates unfair competition with savings accounts, which must comply with far stricter capital and liquidity requirements.",
        "On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union has chosen a more cautious path. Its MiCA regulation, fully applicable since the end of 2024, restricts the use of non-euro stablecoins for everyday payments and imposes strict reserve rules. The European Central Bank fears that dollar-based tokens could weaken the euro's international role, and it is pushing for a digital euro instead.",
        "Some bankers, however, see an opportunity rather than a threat. Several large lenders are testing “tokenised deposits”, which offer the speed of blockchain payments while remaining inside the regulated banking system. “The question is not whether money will become digital,” says a senior executive at a European bank. “It is who will control the rails.” Whoever wins that race could reshape global finance for decades."

      source: 'Practice text — inspired by the British business press, 2026',
      date: 'September 2026',
      question: 'Do you think artificial intelligence will make auditors more reliable or simply less necessary?',
      paragraphs: [
        "Every busy season, armies of young graduates spend long nights checking invoices, matching bank statements and testing samples of transactions. For the Big Four accounting firms — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG — this repetitive work has long been the entry point into the profession. Artificial intelligence is now changing that model faster than many partners expected.",
        "All four firms have announced investments worth billions of dollars in AI tools over the past three years. Instead of testing a small sample, software can now analyse every single transaction of a client, flag unusual payments and draft parts of the audit file. “We used to look at 60 invoices out of 100,000; now the machine reads all of them and tells us which ten deserve a human eye,” explains an audit manager in London.",
        "The impact on jobs is already visible. Several firms have reduced graduate recruitment in the UK and the US, and some have lowered their audit fees in competitive tenders, arguing that automation cuts costs. Critics fear that if juniors no longer perform the basic tasks, they will never develop the professional judgement they will need as partners ten years later.",
        "Regulators are also cautious. Audit watchdogs have warned that firms do not always monitor how AI tools affect audit quality. An algorithm may detect anomalies, but it cannot ask a chief financial officer an awkward question, nor assess whether management is under pressure to hit its targets. Recent scandals, from Wirecard in Germany to the collapse of large construction groups in Britain, were not caused by a lack of data but by a lack of professional scepticism.",
        "There is also a question of trust. If an AI tool makes a mistake, who is responsible: the software provider, the audit firm or the partner who signs the opinion? Under current standards, the answer is clear — the auditor remains fully liable. That is why firms insist that AI is an assistant, not a replacement.",
        "Supporters believe the technology could finally fix the audit's reputation problem. By saving time on routine checks, auditors could focus on high-risk areas such as revenue recognition, goodwill or accounting estimates. “AI will not replace auditors,” one partner says, “but auditors who use AI will replace those who don't.” Whether the profession can still attract and train the next generation remains, however, an open question."

      date: 'April 2026',
      question: "To what extent does the EU's Omnibus package mark a step back for corporate social responsibility?",
      paragraphs: [
        "When the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) was adopted in 2022, Brussels presented it as a revolution: around 50,000 European companies would have to publish detailed information on their environmental and social impact, checked by auditors like their financial accounts, using common European standards. Less than four years later, that ambition has been sharply reduced, and the debate over what Europe really expects from its companies has been reopened.",
        "The “Omnibus I” package, published as Directive (EU) 2026/470 and in force since 18 March 2026, limits sustainability reporting to companies with more than 1,000 employees and a net turnover above €450 million. The due diligence directive (CSDDD), which obliges firms to identify human rights and environmental abuses in their supply chains, now applies only to groups with more than 5,000 employees and €1.5 billion in turnover. About nine out of ten companies originally concerned are now out of scope.",
        "For business organisations, this is simple common sense. European firms, they argue, were drowning in paperwork while their American and Chinese competitors faced no similar obligations. A high-profile report on European competitiveness had already warned in 2024 that excessive regulation was holding back growth. “We support sustainability, not bureaucracy,” says the head of a French employers' federation.",
        "Small and medium-sized enterprises are relieved too. Many had started hiring consultants and buying software to measure their carbon footprint, sometimes spending more than €100,000 a year. Under the new rules, large clients will also be limited in the amount of information they can demand from their smaller suppliers.",
        "Environmental groups and many investors see things differently. They argue that reliable, comparable data is essential to fight greenwashing and to channel capital towards the energy transition. Some companies that had already invested heavily in reporting feel penalised for having moved early. The removal of the obligation to adopt climate transition plans under the due diligence directive has been particularly criticised.",
        "Some experts believe the debate is less about ethics than about strategy. Large companies will keep reporting, investors will keep asking questions, and many smaller firms may continue voluntarily because their customers and banks expect it. “Regulation was never the only driver of CSR,” notes a governance professor in Paris. “The real test is whether companies keep their commitments now that the law no longer forces them to.”"

      source: 'Practice text — inspired by the American financial press, 2026',
      date: 'March 2026',
      question: 'Do you think the current boom in artificial intelligence investment is sustainable?',
      paragraphs: [
        "Never before have companies spent so much, so fast, on a single technology. In 2025 the largest American tech groups invested around $400 billion in data centres, chips and energy to power artificial intelligence, and they plan to spend even more in 2026. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for roughly a third of the value of the S&P 500 index.",
        "For enthusiasts, this is only the beginning. AI assistants are already writing code, answering customer queries and summarising legal documents. Banks use them to detect fraud, and manufacturers to predict when machines will break down. In October 2025, chipmaker Nvidia became the first company in history to be valued at more than $5 trillion. “This is the biggest platform shift since the internet,” argues a Silicon Valley investor.",
        "Sceptics, however, see worrying similarities with the dot-com bubble of 2000. Revenues from AI services remain small compared with the money invested, and a widely cited study in 2025 suggested that most corporate AI pilot projects had not yet produced any measurable financial return. Several analysts also point to “circular” deals, in which chipmakers invest in AI start-ups that then use the money to buy their chips.",
        "The debt dimension is new. While the giants finance most of their spending from their own profits, smaller players and data-centre developers increasingly rely on bonds and private credit. If demand for computing power were to slow down, lenders could be left with expensive buildings full of rapidly ageing equipment.",
        "There is also a human question. Companies hope AI will boost productivity, but employees fear for their jobs, particularly in entry-level office roles. Some firms have already justified job cuts by citing automation, while others report that their staff do not trust the tools and use them only occasionally. Training, data quality and cybersecurity have turned out to be far more difficult than the marketing promised.",
        "Even if valuations fall, history suggests that the technology itself may survive. After the dot-com crash, many investors lost fortunes, but the internet went on to transform the economy. “A bubble and a revolution are not mutually exclusive,” notes a London-based economist. The real question for businesses is not whether AI matters, but who will capture its value — and when."

      date: 'June 2026',
      question: 'To what extent should companies force their employees to return to the office?',
      paragraphs: [
        "Six years after the pandemic emptied office towers, many employers have decided that enough is enough. Amazon has required its corporate staff to come in five days a week since January 2025, and banks such as JPMorgan Chase followed a few months later. In France, several large groups have reduced the number of remote-working days allowed in their company agreements.",
        "Executives give several reasons. They say that collaboration, innovation and company culture suffer when teams rarely meet in person, and that young employees learn their job by watching experienced colleagues. “You cannot build trust on a video call,” says the HR director of a European insurer. Some managers also admit, privately, that they find it difficult to supervise staff they never see.",
        "Employees, however, have grown used to flexibility. Surveys consistently show that hybrid work is one of the benefits they value most, sometimes as much as a pay rise. Long commutes, high housing costs in city centres and childcare constraints make a full return difficult, especially for parents and people with disabilities. Many also say they are more productive at home, where they face fewer interruptions.",
        "Research does not clearly support either side. A large experiment carried out at a Chinese travel company and published in 2024 found that allowing two days at home a week reduced resignations by a third without harming performance. Other studies suggest that fully remote teams can struggle with innovation and with the training of newcomers.",
        "Critics also suspect hidden motives. Some argue that strict office mandates are a discreet way to reduce headcount, since some staff will prefer to resign rather than return. Others point out that many companies have signed long and expensive office leases that they now need to justify. Trade unions warn that such policies may push out precisely the most talented employees, who can easily find a more flexible employer elsewhere.",
        "Between these positions, a growing number of firms are trying to redefine the purpose of the office: fewer desks, more meeting rooms, and “anchor days” when whole teams are present at the same time. “The question is no longer where people work,” says a management consultant, “but what they come to the office to do.” For HR departments, the challenge is to make the office worth the commute."

      question: 'Discuss the view that tariffs are an effective way to bring production back home.',
      paragraphs: [
        "For more than a year, American importers lived with constant uncertainty. Tariffs imposed under an emergency economic law were raised, suspended and renegotiated almost every month, forcing manufacturers to redesign their supply chains in a hurry. Then, on 20 February 2026, the US Supreme Court ruled by six votes to three in Learning Resources v. Trump that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not allow the President to impose such duties.",
        "The decision opened the door to refunds that analysts estimate at between $142 billion and $170 billion. But relief was short-lived: the administration immediately introduced a temporary 10% tariff on most imports under a different legal basis, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which limits it to 150 days unless Congress extends it, while sector-specific duties on steel, aluminium and cars remained in place.",
        "For supply-chain managers, the lesson is clear: trade policy has become a permanent risk. “We no longer plan for the cheapest route, but for the most resilient one,” explains the operations director of a US furniture maker. Many firms have adopted a “China plus one” strategy, moving part of their production to Vietnam, India or Mexico while keeping key suppliers in Asia. Others have mapped their suppliers' own suppliers for the first time, to identify hidden dependencies.",
        "Reshoring to the United States itself has been more limited than politicians hoped. Several large projects have been announced, especially in semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, but building a factory takes years, and manufacturers complain of a shortage of skilled workers. Because labour costs are higher, new plants are often highly automated and create fewer jobs than expected.",
        "Tariffs have also had a cost. Companies that depend on imported components have seen their margins squeezed, and part of the extra cost has been passed on to consumers. Small businesses, which lack the bargaining power of large groups, have been hit hardest. Some economists argue that uncertainty itself — rather than the level of duties — has discouraged investment.",
        "European exporters are watching closely. Many have increased their inventories, diversified their logistics routes and, in some cases, opened assembly lines in the United States to stay close to their customers. “Tariffs can change in a week; a factory stays for thirty years,” notes a supply-chain consultant in Rotterdam. For most companies, the real goal is now flexibility rather than relocation."
