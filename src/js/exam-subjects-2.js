      source: 'Practice text — inspired by the business press on influencer marketing, 2026',
      date: 'March 2026',
      question: 'To what extent should brands be held responsible for the way influencers collect and use their followers\' personal data?',
      paragraphs: [
        "Influencer marketing has grown from a niche experiment into a global industry worth an estimated $35 billion a year. Cosmetics groups, sportswear makers and even banks now spend a growing share of their advertising budgets on creators who promote products to audiences of a few thousand or several million followers. For brands, the appeal is obvious: a recommendation from a trusted face feels more authentic than a television commercial.",
        "Yet the business model rests on something less visible than a smiling video: data. Behind every sponsored post, agencies and platforms track clicks, discount codes, comments and purchases. Some creators go further, running giveaways that require followers to share their email address, date of birth or even their shopping habits. This information is then passed on to partner brands, often without clear consent.",
        "Regulators have started to notice. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation already requires a lawful basis and transparent information whenever personal data is collected, while the Digital Services Act forbids targeted advertising aimed at minors. France went further in 2023 with a dedicated law on commercial influence, which obliges creators to label sponsored content and bans the promotion of certain risky products.",
        "\"Many brands still behave as if the influencer were a separate company and the data problem were not theirs,\" says a consumer-law specialist at a London firm. \"But when a campaign is designed, briefed and paid for by a brand, regulators increasingly consider that the brand shares responsibility for what happens to the data.\"",
        "Marketers argue that they cannot police thousands of independent creators. Contracts typically include a clause requiring compliance with privacy rules, but checks are rare. A survey of European marketing directors published last year found that fewer than one in three had ever audited how a partner influencer collected follower information.",
        "The stakes are rising. Young audiences, who make up the core of many creators' communities, are particularly exposed, and consumer associations have filed complaints against several fashion and gaming campaigns. At the same time, the decline of third-party cookies — blocked by Safari and Firefox and limited by consent rules, although Google decided to keep them in Chrome — has made first-party data — collected directly from consumers — more valuable than ever, encouraging brands to look for new ways to gather it.",
        "Some companies are choosing transparency as a selling point, publishing the list of creators they work with and limiting data collection to what is strictly necessary. Whether this becomes the norm, or whether regulators will have to impose it, remains an open question."

      title: 'When taking a stand costs sales: the new risks of brand activism',
      source: 'Practice text — inspired by the business press on brand activism and consumer boycotts, 2026',
      date: 'January 2026',
      question: 'Should brands take public positions on social and political issues?',
      paragraphs: [
        "For much of the last decade, marketing experts gave companies the same advice: stand for something. Surveys showed that younger consumers, in particular, expected brands to speak out on climate change, diversity or human rights, and many firms responded with campaigns that went far beyond the qualities of their products.",
        "The mood has changed. In 2023, a single sponsored post by a transgender influencer for an American beer brand triggered a boycott that cost the brand its position as the best-selling beer in the United States. Since then, several retailers and consumer-goods groups have quietly scaled back their diversity programmes or dropped campaigns that might be seen as political. Advertising agencies report that clients now ask for \"risk assessments\" before any campaign touching on social issues, a practice almost unknown five years ago.",
        "Boycotts now come from both sides of the political spectrum. Some consumers punish brands for being too progressive; others turn away from companies whose leaders are associated with controversial political figures. In 2025, an electric-car maker saw its European registrations fall sharply as customers reacted to its chief executive's political involvement. In France, calls to boycott American products also spread online after the trade tensions of the same year, even if their real effect on sales was limited.",
        "\"The problem is not taking a stand, it is taking a stand that the company cannot defend,\" argues a brand strategist based in New York. \"Consumers can tell the difference between a value that is embedded in the business and a slogan invented for a campaign.\" Critics call the latter \"woke-washing\", by analogy with greenwashing.",
        "Researchers point out that the impact of boycotts is often short-lived. Sales typically recover within months, unless the controversy touches the core identity of the brand. Yet in a world of social networks, where a video can reach millions of people in a few hours, few marketing directors are willing to take the risk.",
        "Silence, however, is not neutral either. Employees, especially younger ones, increasingly expect their employer to share their values, and investors focused on environmental, social and governance criteria ask for consistency between public statements and actual practices. A company that says nothing may be accused of indifference.",
        "As a result, many brands are adopting what consultants call \"quiet activism\": fewer loud campaigns, more concrete action on issues directly linked to their activity, such as packaging, working conditions or local communities. Whether consumers will reward this discretion remains to be seen."

      question: 'Is the concentration of venture capital in artificial intelligence start-ups a danger for investors and for innovation?',
      paragraphs: [
        "Never has so much risk capital chased a single idea. According to industry trackers, artificial intelligence start-ups attracted roughly half of all venture capital invested worldwide in 2025, up from about a quarter two years earlier. A handful of companies developing large language models raised individual rounds of several billion dollars, at valuations that would have seemed absurd for loss-making businesses only a few years ago.",
        "Venture capital funds traditionally spread their money across dozens of young companies, knowing that most will fail and that a few spectacular successes will pay for the losses. The AI boom is changing this logic. Training advanced models requires enormous amounts of computing power, so the leading laboratories need sums that only the largest funds, sovereign wealth funds and tech giants can provide.",
        "\"We are no longer financing garages, we are financing power stations,\" says a partner at a European venture firm. \"The cheque sizes have changed the whole ecosystem.\" Smaller funds complain that they are priced out of the best deals, while start-ups in other sectors, from health to clean energy, find it harder to raise money. In Europe, where funds are smaller than in Silicon Valley, the gap is even more visible: the continent's most promising AI companies often have to turn to American investors to finance their growth.",
        "The circular nature of some deals also worries analysts. Chip makers and cloud providers invest in AI start-ups, which then spend much of that money buying chips and cloud services from their own investors. Supporters see a rational alliance between partners; sceptics see revenue that is partly artificial.",
        "There are also concerns about exits. Venture investors make money when a start-up is listed on the stock exchange or sold to a larger company. Initial public offerings have remained rare, and competition authorities are looking closely at the way big tech firms take stakes in promising rivals or hire their teams without formally buying them.",
        "Defenders of the boom point out that every technological revolution, from railways to the internet, went through periods of excessive investment. Even if many companies disappear, the infrastructure and skills they leave behind can benefit the whole economy.",
        "For pension funds and insurers that entrust their money to venture funds, the question is more immediate: are they financing the next great industry, or the next bubble?"

Companies combined to share costs, as when two European groups joined forces in 2021 to create one of the world's largest carmakers. Today, faced with the expensive shift to electric vehicles and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers, many executives are choosing a different path: working with their rivals without merging.",
        "The examples are multiplying. A German group has invested several billion dollars in a joint venture with an American electric-vehicle start-up to develop software. A French manufacturer and a Chinese partner have created a common company to produce engines and hybrid systems. Elsewhere, competitors share battery plants, charging networks and even vehicle platforms, while continuing to fight for customers in the showroom. Japanese carmakers, long known for their independence, have also multiplied cross-shareholdings and technical agreements in hybrid and hydrogen technologies.",
        "Economists call this \"coopetition\", a combination of cooperation and competition. Its advantages are clear. Partners share the huge costs of research and development, gain access to skills they lack and move faster than they could alone. Unlike a merger, a partnership can be limited to one activity and ended if it does not work.",
        "\"A merger is a marriage; a joint venture is a project,\" explains a strategy professor at a Paris business school. \"Mergers are slow, they require approval from competition authorities and, according to many studies, a majority fail to create the value promised to shareholders, often because of cultural clashes.\"",
        "Coopetition is not without risks, however. Sharing technology with a competitor can mean giving away know-how that took years to develop. Governance can be complicated when partners disagree, and the balance of power may shift if one side learns faster than the other. Some Western managers fear that alliances with Chinese firms could, in the long term, strengthen their most dangerous competitor.",
        "Mergers and acquisitions have not disappeared. Global deal volumes recovered in 2025 as interest rates fell, and buying a company remains the quickest way to gain market share or eliminate a rival. But in industries where technology changes quickly, flexibility has become a strategic asset.",
        "The question for executives is no longer simply whether to buy or to build, but whom to trust — and for how long."

      source: 'Practice text — inspired by the accounting and financial press, 2026',
      date: 'May 2026',
      question: 'Should accounting standards allow companies to recognise internally generated intangible assets, such as brands and data, on their balance sheets?',
      paragraphs: [
        "Look at the balance sheet of a large technology or luxury company and something seems to be missing. Its most valuable assets — its brands, its customer data, its software, the know-how of its staff — are largely absent. According to several estimates, intangible assets now account for around 90% of the market value of the largest American listed companies, compared with less than 20% in the 1970s.",
        "The reason lies in the accounting rules. Under international standards, a company can record an intangible asset only if it is identifiable, controlled and likely to generate future benefits, and if its cost can be measured reliably. In practice, a brand built over decades by advertising, or a database created by millions of users, cannot be recognised: the money spent on it is treated as an expense.",
        "The situation changes completely when a company is bought. The acquirer must then record the target's brands and customer relationships at fair value, and any remaining difference between the price paid and the net assets becomes goodwill. As a result, two similar companies can show very different balance sheets simply because one grew by acquisitions and the other did not.",
        "Goodwill itself is controversial. It is no longer amortised under international standards but tested each year for impairment. Critics say these tests are \"too little, too late\": managers, who are reluctant to admit that a deal was a mistake, rely on optimistic forecasts, and losses are recognised only when the market has already understood them. Several large European groups have announced impairment losses of several billion euros in recent years, often years after the acquisitions concerned, and their share prices barely moved, a sign that markets had already priced in the loss.",
        "\"Financial statements were designed for factories, not for algorithms,\" says a former audit partner at a Big Four firm. \"Investors now get more useful information from the management report than from the balance sheet.\"",
        "The International Accounting Standards Board has launched research on the subject, but reform faces a real dilemma. Recognising internally generated brands or data would make balance sheets more relevant, but valuing them requires many assumptions and could open the door to manipulation. Auditors, for their part, warn that they would struggle to verify figures that rely so heavily on management judgement.",
        "Some propose a middle way: better disclosures in the notes rather than new assets on the balance sheet. For users of accounts, the debate is far from academic."

      question: 'To what extent can shareholder activism improve corporate governance?',
      paragraphs: [
        "The annual general meeting season used to be a formality. This year, at several large European and American companies, it turned into a battle. Investors voted against pay packages they considered excessive, and activist funds demanded seats on boards, changes of strategy and, in some cases, the departure of the chief executive.",
        "Executive pay is at the heart of the tension. In the United States, the average chief executive of a large listed company now earns close to 300 times as much as a typical employee, compared with about 20 times in the 1960s. European packages are smaller but growing quickly, partly because companies argue they must compete with American salaries to attract talent. Long-term incentive plans, paid in shares, now represent the largest part of most packages, which means that a rising stock market can multiply the final amount received.",
        "Since the 2010s, \"say on pay\" rules have given shareholders a vote on directors' remuneration. In the European Union, this vote has become compulsory for listed companies, and in France a negative vote can block the payment of variable bonuses. In the United States, by contrast, the vote is only advisory: boards can ignore it, as some have done after shareholders rejected their proposals.",
        "Activist investors claim to be the guardians of good governance. \"Boards too often protect management rather than challenge it,\" says the head of a London-based activist fund. \"We ask the questions that independent directors should have asked.\" Some campaigns have led to clearer strategies, the sale of unprofitable divisions or stronger links between pay and long-term performance.",
        "Critics see things differently. They accuse some activists of short-termism: pushing for share buybacks, higher dividends or job cuts that boost the share price quickly, at the expense of investment, employees and the company's long-term future. Trade unions point out that employees, who are also stakeholders, rarely have the same influence.",
        "The rise of proxy advisers, which recommend how institutional investors should vote, adds another layer to the debate. Their supporters say they help investors analyse thousands of resolutions; their opponents accuse them of applying the same checklist to every company.",
        "Between passive index funds that rarely vote against management and aggressive activists, the challenge is to find shareholders who behave like responsible owners — and boards willing to listen to them."
